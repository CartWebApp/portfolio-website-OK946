            <h2>Post-Secondary Plan</h2>
            <p>After high school, I plan on going to a community college for two years to start a computer science major and take my general education classes. After those two years I plan to go to a four year college and double major in computer science and video game design. While this plan involves a lot of work, I truly believe that I can accomplish this.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
        <p>While I spend a large portion of my time in front of a computer either working or playing video games, I also engage in other hobbies. I have been playing the drums for about four years and enjoy the process of constantly challenging myself to do better. I also have been interested in photography for about three years and have been taking photos primarily of nature and animals.</p>

        <h2>Awards/Accomplishments</h2>
        <p>I have maintained an above 4.00 GPA since my sophomore year of high school and work hard to achieve good grades in my classes. As a perfectionist, I rarely am happy with myself unless I get A’s in a class, so this has led me to only having two B’s in all my classes I have taken in high school. </p>
