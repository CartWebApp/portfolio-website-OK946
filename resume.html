                <p>Worked on a team with two UX Designers and one other Web Developer to create a new website for the company Trion Supercars.

                <p>I have spent about one hundred hours volunteering at my local church. I have aided with multiple summer camps by watching over up to twenty children at once. I also worked the set up for those same activities by setting up furniture and sorting materials for later use. I often serve in a leadership role during these camps and am often referred to when one of the other volunteers has a question.</p>
