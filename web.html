            <h2>March 2025 - May 2025</h2>
            <a class="webImg" href="https://finalhorseheist.netlify.app/"><img class="webImg" src="/images/finalHorse.png"></a>
            <p>This game was created for a school project as our final test of JavaScript for the year. I worked on this along with a partner to create a humourous game that isn't meant to be taken too seriously. I did a majority of the JavaScript for this project, allowing me to experiment with the systems and grow my skills. I was able to get far ahead of my other classmates during this project and I truly had fun while creating it. This enjoyability in a large coding project made me a much harder worker.</p>

            <h2>February 2025 - March 2025</h2>
            <a class="webImg" href="https://budgetpercentagecalculator.netlify.app/"><img class="webImg" src="/images/budgetCalc.png"></a>
            <p>This is a budget calculator that was made for the credit union EECU according to their specifications, such as having a preloaded list of jobs to choose from. It allows users to view information like how much money is being taken away by taxes and other deductions, and allows users to input other expenses. The site was fully coded in VS Code using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS and prototyped in Figma. The most challenging part of the website was learning to understand chart.js to create a donut graph on the site. This site was one of the first websites that I was truly proud of, as I believe it is very professional and functional to most people. This reinforced my knowledge of the aforementioned programming languages.</p>

            <h2>October 2024 - January 2025</h2>
            <a class="webImg" href="https://trisupercar.netlify.app/"><img class="webImg" src="/images/triSupercar.png"></a>
            <p>This is a full, 15+ page website created for the supercar company Trion Supercars that includes a variety of features such as the ability to customize a car. This project was worked on by three other individuals apart from myself; one other web developer and two UX designers. It was designed using Figma and created using HTML and CSS in VS Code. I personally served as a leader for the project by attempting to maintain order in the group and make sure we met the deadlines given to us. Creating this website gave us a lot of trouble as we had to ensure that it was compatible for mobile devices, which mostly got done by the time of our last deadline.</p>

            <h2>September 2024 - October 2024</h2>
            <a class="webImg" href="https://smart-home-webpages.netlify.app/"><img class="webImg" src="/images/smartHome.png"></a>
            <p>This website was a school project that was meant to replicate how a smart home may be advertised through a website resembling other home building websites. It was first designed in Figma before being coded using HTML and CSS. Through this project, I was able to learn how to use HTML and CSS to create websites that are both visually appealing and functional. This was my first full attempt at using both of these programming languages to create a multi-page website.</p>
